# Custom ByteTrack configuration for THE KITCHEN
# Optimized for crossing robustness in restaurant environment

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.30     # Lower = more tracks kept during occlusion
track_low_thresh:  0.05     # Very low — pick up even faint detections
new_track_thresh:  0.60     # High = only create new track when confident (avoids ghost tracks)

# CROSSING KEY PARAMETER:
# track_buffer = frames to keep a "lost" track alive before discarding
# At 20fps: 60 frames = 3s. Use high value to survive crossing occlusions.
track_buffer: 90            # 90 frames (~4.5s at 20fps) — survive long crossings

# IOU matching — CRITICAL for crossing behavior
# Lower = more lenient during crossing (tracks that overlap less are still matched)
match_thresh: 0.70          # Was 0.85 — now 0.70 so crossing tracks still match
fuse_score: true            # Fuse detection confidence with IOU
